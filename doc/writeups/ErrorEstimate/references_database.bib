  Abstract                 = {The successful treatment of port wine stain (PWS) patients undergoing laser therapy is based on selective thermal coagulation of blood vessels without damaging the normal overlying epidermis. Cryogen spray cooling of skin may offer an effective method for minimizing epidermal thermal injury. Inasmuch as the density of melanosomes and depth of PWS blood vessels can vary considerably, an optimum cooling strategy is required on an individual patient basis. The authors present a theoretical study of the thermal response of various pigmented PWS lesions to spray cooling in conjunction with flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser irradiation (585 nm). Results of the authors' model indicate that precooling of skin using tetrafluoroethane as the cryogen spray is sufficient to eliminate epidermal thermal injury when using incident fluences less than 10 J cm -2 and 8 J cm -2 on patients with intermediate and high epidermal melanin content, respectively. Cryogens that have lower boiling points than tetrafluoroethane may allow successful treatment when using fluences equal to or greater than those indicated.},

In this paper, we will discuss and compare a number of these boundary conditions, like perfectly matched layers (PMLs), open (leaky mode) boundary conditions and transparent boundary conditions (TBCs). We will also introduce the case of PMLs with infinite absorption and discuss its relation to leaky mode expansion, leading to a deeper insight into the physics of PML.},

  Abstract                 = {Selective photodamage of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a new technique to treat a variety of retinal diseases without causing adverse effects to surrounding tissues such as the neural retina including the photoreceptors and the choroid. In this study, the mechanism of cell damage after laser irradiation was investigated.Single porcine RPE-melanosomes and RPE cells were irradiated with a Nd:YLF laser (wavelength lambda = 527 nm, adjustable pulse duration tau = 250 nsec-3 musec) and a Nd:YAG laser (lambda = 532 nm, tau = 8 nsec). Fast flash photography was applied to observe vaporization at melanosomes in suspension. A fluorescence viability assay was used to probe the cells vitality.The threshold radiant exposures for vaporization around individual melanosomes and for ED50 cell damage are similar at 8-nsec pulse duration. Both thresholds increase with pulse duration; however, the ED50 cell damage radiant exposure is 40% lower at 3musec. Temperature calculations to model the onset of vaporization around the melanosomes are in good agreement with the experimental results when assuming a surface temperature of 150C to initiate vaporization and a homogeneous melanosome absorption coefficient of 8,000 cm-1. Increasing the number of pulses delivered to RPE cells at a repetition rate of 500 Hz, the ED50 value decreases for all pulse durations. However, the behavior does not obey scaling laws such as the N equation.The origin of RPE cell damage for single pulse irradiation up to pulse durations of 3 musec can be described by a damage mechanism in which microbubbles around the melanosomes cause a rupture of the cell structure. The threshold radiant exposure for RPE damage decreases with increasing number of pulses applied. Lasers Surg. Med. 27:451-464, 2000.  2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {The shielding effectiveness of laser-induced breakdown from focused, visible laser pulses from 5 ns to 125 fs is determined from measurements of transmission of energy through the focal volume. The shielding efficiency decreases as a function of pulse duration from 5 ns to 300 fs and increases from 300 fs to 125 fs. The results are compared with past studies at similar pulse durations. The results of the measurements support laser-induced breakdown models and may lead to an optimization of laser-induced breakdown in ophthalmic surgery by reduction of collateral effects.},

  Abstract                 = {An approximate analytical formulation is presented that allows for the calculation of acoustic pressure thresholds for transient cavitation over a variety of frequencies and host fluid parameters. Specifically, R.E. Apfel's (1986) theory is extended to include an estimate of the time delay associated with the Laplace pressure, 2s/R0, where s is the surface tension and R0 is the initial radius. Also presented is a correction factor for the time-averaged pressure difference, across the bubble wall during growth. An optimum size distribution of nuclei for the predisposition of a sample to microcavitation is exhibited. The role of transient cavitation in medical ultrasound is discussed},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a review of basic theories and recent advances in the studies of wave propagation and scattering in random media. Examples of the random media include the atmosphere, the ocean, and biological media whose characteristics are randomly varying in time and space. The study of electromagnetic, optical, and acoustic waves in such media has become increasingly important in recent years in the areas of communication, detection, and remote-sensing. Topics covered in this paper are divided into "waves in randomly distributed scatterers," "waves in random continua," and "remote-sensing of random media." Transport theory with various approximate solutions and multiple scattering theories are discussed and their relationships are clarified. Included in the analyses are propagation characteristics of intensities, wave fluctuations, pulse propagation and scattering, coherence bandwidth, and coherence time of communication channels through random media. Remote-sensing techniques include recent advances in the use of inversion techniques to deal with ill-posed problems.},

The model is derived from the simple rate equation formalism of Shen for cascade breakdown in solids and from the theory of multiphoton ionization in condensed media developed by Keldysh. Analytic expressions have been obtained for the irradiance thresholds corresponding to multiphoton breakdown, to cascade breakdown, and to initiation of cascade breakdown by multiphoton ionization of seed electrons (multiphoton initiation threshold). The model has been incorporated into a computer code and code results compared to experimentally measured irradiance thresholds for breakdown of ocular and aqueous media by nanosecond, picosecond, and femtosecond laser pulses in the visible and near-infrared. The code and comparison of code results to experiment have been documented in part II},

An analytic, first-order model has been developed to calculate irradiance thresholds for laser-induced breakdown (LIB) in condensed media, including ocular and aqueous media. A complete derivation and description of the model was given in a previous paper (Part I). The model has been incorporated into a computer code and code results have been compared to experimentally measured irradiance thresholds for breakdown of ocular media, saline, and water by nanosecond, picosecond, and femtosecond laser pulses in the visible and near-infrared. The comparison included both breakdown data from the literature and from our own measurements. Theoretical values match experiment to within a factor of 2 or better, over a range of pulsewidths spanning five orders of magnitude},

  Abstract                 = {This Account discusses surface-enhanced Raman scattering at extremely high enhancement levels that can occur for molecules attached to silver and gold nanoclusters. Strongly enhanced and highly confined local optical fields enable surface-enhanced Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy of single molecules even under nonresonant excitation conditions as well as extremely large effective cross sections in two-photon excited Raman spectroscopy. The ability for very sensitive and spatially confined molecular structural probing makes gold and silver nanoclusters very promising tools for studies of small structures in biological materials, such as cellular compartments.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the propagation of ultrashort pulsed beam (down to the limit of single-cycle pulse) beyond the paraxial approximation in free space. By application of the perturbation method, the nonparaxial corrections to an arbitrary paraxial solution are given in a series form. The rigorous nonparaxial results are obtained for comparison by numerical simulation. It shows that the second-order correction can guarantee a good precision in describing the nonparaxial propagation of a single-cycle pulsed beam, whose beam waist width is of the order of the central wavelength. The nonparaxial propagation of isodiffracting pulsed Gaussian beam is given in detail. It shows the temporal distribution inevitably influences the spatial distribution of the correction due to the inherent spatiotemporal coupling in the pulsed beam.},

  Abstract                 = {The retinal damage thresholds for large spot size, multiple-pulse exposures to a Q-switched, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm wavelength, 7 ns pulses) have been measured for 100 m and 500 m retinal irradiance diameters. The ED50, expressed as energy per pulse, varies only weakly with the number of pulses, n, for these extended spot sizes. The previously reported threshold for a multiple-pulse exposure for a 900 m retinal spot size also shows the same weak dependence on the number of pulses. The multiple-pulse ED50 for an extended spot-size exposure does not follow the n dependence exhibited by small spot size exposures produced by a collimated beam. Curves derived by using probability-summation models provide a better fit to the data.},

  Abstract                 = {A more exact model is suggested for the description of nonlinear light propagation in fibers. In addition to the previously discussed self-phase modulation, parametric, dispersion, self-steepening, and Raman self-scattering effects, this model also takes into account the Stokes losses associated with the material excitation, the dependence of nonlinear effects on the light frequency, and the frequency dependence of the fiber mode area. The self-steepening effect is taken into account more correctly in comparison with previous models. The effects influence considerably the femtosecond soliton propagation. The model is generalized for the case of various fiber dispersion properties along the fiber length. The possibility of obtaining high-quality pulses of less than 15-fsec duration by compression of fundamental solitons with approximately 100-fsec duration in fibers with slowly decreasing dispersion is shown.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that when a lens produces an image of a point source the three-dimensional diffraction pattern which results is the three-dimensional Fourier transform of a generalization of the lens aperture. This implies similar Fourier relations in one and two dimensions. An explicit form of the former is derived which demonstrates that the amplitude distribution on an arbitrarily directed line through the focus is the Fourier transform of the projection of the generalized aperture onto that line. These relations hold in aberrant as well as in ideal systems. Some examples are worked out by using the one-dimensional relation.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have provided considerable ED50 data for both visible and near infrared wavelengths from single laser pulses below one nanosecond of exposure. The current ANSI Z136.1 standard does not offer an approved maximum permissible exposure limit for subnanosecond single laser pulses and the current suggested maximum permissible exposure limit may be overly conservative. Lacking an approved standard industrial, medical, educational, and military uses of these types of laser systems may be limited or prohibited. A new set of laser maximum permissible exposure limits for subnanosecond visible and near infrared single laser pulses is recommended, along with the steps taken to develop the proposed standard.

  Abstract                 = {The human eye is constantly exposed to sunlight and artificial lighting. Therefore the eye is exposed to UV-B (295-320 nm), UV-A (320-400 nm), and visible light (400-700 nm). Light is transmitted through the eye and then signals the brain directing both sight and circadian rhythm. Therefore light absorbed by the eye must be benign. Damage to the young and adult eye by intense ambient light is avoided because the eye is protected by a very efficient antioxidant system. In addition, there are protective pigments such as the kynurenines, located in the human lens, and melanin, in the uvea and retina, which absorb ambient radiation and dissipate its energy without causing damage. After middle age there is a decrease in the production of antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes. At the same time, the protective pigments are chemically modified (lenticular 3-hydroxy kynurenine pigment is enzymatically converted into the phototoxic chromophore xanthurenic acid; melanin is altered from an antioxidant to pro-oxidant) and fluorescent chromophores (lipofuscin) accumulate to concentrations high enough to produce reactive oxygen species. We have known for some time that exposure to intense artificial light and sunlight either causes or exacerbates age-related ocular diseases. We now know many of the reasons for these effects, and with this knowledge methods are being developed to interfere with these damaging processes.},
